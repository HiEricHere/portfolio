          In mid 2019 I made the oddly comfortable decision to change careers.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          I gave my two week notice, bought a ticket to Seattle and signed up to
          learn web development for the next five months at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>. Abruptly
          uprooting myself from an otherwise steady life and source of income
          was a big decision and I had plenty of doubts going in and not much of
          a safety cushion to fall back on if things did not work out. However,
          these were the least of my worries as the next five months of my life
          became a balancing act of cramming knowledge into my head vs finding
          time to sleep.
        </h3>
        <h3 style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
          Thankfully, this was one of the better decisions I&apos;ve made in my
          life, and I would make the same decision again with no hesitation. See
          below to get an idea of the <span className="orange">languages</span>,{" "}
          <span className="orange">frameworks</span> and{" "}
