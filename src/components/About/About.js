      <h1>Hi, Eric Here</h1>
      <h3>
        Iâ€™m a software developer from the US looking to explore unique growth
        opportunities outside of my comfort zone and find adventure abroad!
      </h3>
      <p>
        My journey into software development began mid 2019 when I tried a bit
        of coding and found it to be really fun and engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be great if I could do this everyday?&quot; I
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began to flirt with the idea of making a career change. I started off
        browsing through bootcamp review sites and then reading through various
        curriculums. There were a lot of words being thrown around: Javascript,
        Ruby, AGILE, MongoDB, SQL, noSQL, MVC, Express, JSON, Asynchronous
        programming, templating, Heroku, DOM manipulation, etc -- A bit
        overwhelming so I started to research current tech being used in the
        industry and started to get a clearer picture of what each bootcamp
        offered. Then I went back to bootcamp shopping with a better idea of
        what I wanted out of my bootcamp experience. It was at this point that I
        realized I was spending the majority of my free time feverishly
        researching all of this, and I certainly never felt the same passion and
        drive for my current line of work, and so the decision to uproot my life
        and change career paths kind of followed naturally. By this time I had
        read hundreds of student reviews, explored possibilities of going to
        bootcamps in Czechoslovakia, Kyoto, and even Bali, and read through so
        many curriculums that they all started to blur together.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end I decided on{" "}
        <a href="https://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a> in Seattle, quit
        my job, bought a ticket to Seattle and then full stack web development
        was my life for the next five months - and I loved every second of it!

      <h1>About This Page</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m building this page for a few reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Practice
            <p>
              Bootcamp was intense, and after almost half a year of the eat &gt;
              code &gt; sleep routine it can be hard to imagine forgetting how
              to do something as basic as setting up GET route from scratch. But
              even just a week or two after graduating I can feel a lot of what
              I learned slipping away. This is to give me something to do and
              also to motivate myself to work on more projects.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Doing things differently ie getting out of my comfort zone
            <p>
              I enjoyed using React on my assignments and projects, so
              that&apos;s what I chose to practice with on this site. To add a
              twist, I&apos;m using functional components rather than class
              components. As I think of new things to implement, I&apos;ll add
              more little challenges for myself.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            3. CSS
            <p>
              In the first month of bootcamp we learned the basics of web dev
              starting with basic HTML/CSS/Javascript. Just pure, static front
              end stuff, so most of the work on a site ended up on making our
              project sites presentable - which meant CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Funnily enough, as we got into the back end and working with
              routes and RESTful APIs and asynchronous programming, seeing a
              JSON object show up on the front end was reward enough and I began
              to care less and less about how it looked like. Websites should be
              functional first, after all. So I find myself in a weird situation
              of wanting to be a front end developer (actually I wouldn&apos;t
              mind being a back end developer either) because React is pretty
              sweet, but jumping back into CSS grid or flexbox is making me want
              to procrastinate - so this is also to get me to relearn CSS.
